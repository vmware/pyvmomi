vim.HostSystem
==============
  The HostSystem managed object type provides access to a virtualization host platform.Invoking destroy on a HostSystem of standalone type throws a NotSupported fault. A standalone HostSystem can be destroyed only by invoking destroy on its parent ComputeResource. Invoking destroy on a failover host throws a `DisallowedOperationOnFailoverHost`_ fault. See `ClusterFailoverHostAdmissionControlPolicy`_ .

  since: `vSphere API 5.1`_


  Privilege:
               System.Read



  Args:


  Returns:
    `vim.host.TpmAttestationReport`_:

UpdateSystemResources(resourceInfo):
   Update the configuration of the system resource hierarchy.


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Resources



  Args:
    resourceInfo (`vim.host.SystemResourceInfo`_):




  Returns:
    None
         

  Raises:

    `vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument`_: 
       if the resource specification is invalid.


UpdateSystemSwapConfiguration(sysSwapConfig):
   Update the System Swap Configuration.See `HostSystemSwapConfiguration`_

  Args:
    sysSwapConfig (`vim.host.SystemSwapConfiguration`_):
       Contains a list of system swap options that configure the system swap functionality.See `HostSystemSwapConfiguration`_ 




  Returns:
    None
         

  Raises:

    `vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument`_: 
       if the supplied sysSwapConfig is not correct.See `HostSystemSwapConfiguration`_ 


ReconnectHost(cnxSpec, reconnectSpec):
   Reconnects to a host. This process reinstalls agents and reconfigures the host, if it has gotten out of date with VirtualCenter. The reconnection process goes through many of the same steps as addHost: ensuring the correct set of licenses for the number of CPUs on the host, ensuring the correct set of agents is installed, and ensuring that networks and datastores are discovered and registered with VirtualCenter.The client can change the IP address and port of the host when doing a reconnect operation. This can be useful if the client wants to preserve existing metadata, even though the host is changing its IP address. For example, clients could preserve existing statistics, alarms, and privileges.This method can also be used to change the SSL thumbprint of a connected host without disconnecting it.Any changes made to the resource hierarchy on the host when the host was disconnected are overriden by VirtualCenter settings on reconnect.This method is only supported through VirtualCenter.


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Connection



  Args:
    cnxSpec (`vim.host.ConnectSpec`_, optional):
       Includes the parameters to use, including user name and password, when reconnecting to the host. If this parameter is not specified, the default connection parameters is used.


    reconnectSpec (`vim.HostSystem.ReconnectSpec`_, optional, since `vSphere API 5.0`_ ):
       Includes connection parameters specific to reconnect. This will mainly be used to indicate how to handle divergence between the host settings and vCenter Server settings when the host was disconnected.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidLogin`_: 
       if the method fails to authenticate with the host.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_:

       if the host is running a software version that is not supported.

    `vim.fault.SSLVerifyFault`_: 
       if the host certificate could not be authenticated.


DisconnectHost():
   Disconnects from a host and instructs the server to stop sending heartbeats.


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Connection



  Args:


  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if run directly on an ESX Server host.


EnterMaintenanceMode(timeout, evacuatePoweredOffVms, maintenanceSpec):
   Puts the host in maintenance mode. While this task is running and when the host is in maintenance mode, no virtual machines can be powered on and no provisioning operations can be performed on the host. Once the call completes, it is safe to turn off a host without disrupting any virtual machines.The task completes once there are no powered-on virtual machines on the host and no provisioning operations in progress on the host. The operation does not directly initiate any operations to evacuate or power-down powered-on virtual machines. However, if the host is part of a cluster with VMware DRS enabled, DRS provides migration recommendations to evacuate the powered-on virtual machines. If DRS is in fully-automatic mode, these are automatically scheduled.If the host is part of a cluster and the task is issued through VirtualCenter with evacuatePoweredOffVms set to true, the task will not succeed unless all the powered-off virtual machines are reregistered to other hosts. If VMware DRS is enabled, vCenter Server will automatically evacuate powered-off virtual machines. The task is cancellable.


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    timeout (`int`_):
       The task completes when the host successfully enters maintenance mode or the timeout expires, and in the latter case the task contains a Timeout fault. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, there is no timeout. The timeout is specified in seconds.


    evacuatePoweredOffVms (`bool`_, optional, since `VI API 2.5`_ ):
       This is a parameter only supported by VirtualCenter. If set to true, for a DRS disabled cluster, the task will not succeed unless all powered-off virtual machines have been manually reregistered; for a DRS enabled cluster, VirtualCenter will automatically reregister powered-off virtual machines and a powered-off virtual machine may remain at the host only for two reasons: (a) no compatible host found for reregistration, (b) DRS is disabled for the virtual machine. If set to false, powered-off virtual machines do not need to be moved.


    maintenanceSpec (`vim.host.MaintenanceSpec`_, optional, since `vSphere API 5.5`_ ):
       Any additional actions to be taken by the host upon entering maintenance mode. If omitted, default actions will be taken as documented in the `HostMaintenanceSpec`_ .




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the host is already in maintenance mode.

    `vim.fault.Timedout`_: 
       if the operation timed out.

    `vmodl.fault.RequestCanceled`_: 
       if the operation is canceled.


ExitMaintenanceMode(timeout):
   Takes the host out of maintenance mode. This blocks if any concurrent running maintenance-only host configurations operations are being performed. For example, if VMFS volumes are being upgraded.The task is cancellable.


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    timeout (`int`_):
       Number of seconds to wait for the exit maintenance mode to succeed. If the timeout is less than or equal to zero, there is no timeout.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the host is not in maintenance mode.

    `vim.fault.Timedout`_: 
       vim.fault.Timedout


RebootHost(force):
   Reboots a host. If the command is successful, then the host has been rebooted. If connected directly to the host, the client never receives an indicator of success in the returned task but simply loses connection to the host, upon success.This command is not supported on all hosts. Check the host capability `vim.host.Capability.rebootSupported`_ .


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    force (`bool`_):
       Flag to specify whether or not the host should be rebooted regardless of whether it is in maintenance mode. If true, the host is rebooted, even if there are virtual machines running or other operations in progress.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if "force" is false and the host is not in maintenance mode.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host does not support the reboot operation.


ShutdownHost(force):
   Shuts down a host. If the command is successful, then the host has been shut down. Thus, the client never receives an indicator of success in the returned task if connected directly to the host.This command is not supported on all hosts. Check the host capability `shutdownSupported`_ .


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    force (`bool`_):
       Flag to specify whether or not the host should be shut down regardless of whether it is in maintenance mode. If true, the host is shut down, even if there are virtual machines running or other operations in progress.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if "force" is false and the host is not in maintenance mode.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host does not support shutdown.


PowerDownHostToStandBy(timeoutSec, evacuatePoweredOffVms):
   Puts the host in standby mode, a mode in which the host is in a standby state from which it can be powered up remotely. While this task is running, no virtual machines can be powered on and no provisioning operations can be performed on the host.The task completes only if there are no powered-on virtual machines on the host, no provisioning operations in progress on the host, and the host stopped responding. The operation does not directly initiate any operations to evacuate or power-down powered-on virtual machines. However, if a dynamic recommendation generation module is running, if possible, it will provide, and depending on the automation level, it will execute migrations of powered-on virtual machine. Furthermore, VMware power management module may evacute and put a host in standby mode to save power. If the host is part of a cluster and the task is issued through VirtualCenter with evacuatePoweredOffVms set to true, the task will not succeed unless all the powered-off virtual machines are reregistered to other hosts. If VMware DRS is enabled, vCenter Server will automatically evacuate powered-off virtual machines.The task is cancellable.This command is not supported on all hosts. Check the host capability `standbySupported`_ .
  since: `VI API 2.5`_


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    timeoutSec (`int`_):
       The task completes when the host successfully enters standby mode and stops sending heartbeat signals. If heartbeats are still coming after timeoutSecs seconds, the host is declared timedout, and the task is assumed failed.


    evacuatePoweredOffVms (`bool`_, optional):
       This is a parameter used only by VirtualCenter. If set to true, for a DRS disabled cluster, the task will not succeed unless all powered-off virtual machines have been manually reregistered; for a DRS enabled cluster, VirtualCenter will automatically reregister powered-off virtual machines and a powered-off virtual machine may remain at the host only for two reasons: (a) no compatible host found for reregistration, (b) DRS is disabled for the virtual machine.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.HostPowerOpFailed`_: 
       if the standby operation fails.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the host is already in standby mode, or disconnected.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host does not support standby mode.

    `vim.fault.Timedout`_: 
       vim.fault.Timedout

    `vmodl.fault.RequestCanceled`_: 
       if the operation is canceled.


PowerUpHostFromStandBy(timeoutSec):
   Takes the host out of standby mode. If the command is successful, the host wakes up and starts sending heartbeats. This method may be called automatically by a dynamic recommendation generation module to add capacity to a cluster, if the host is not in maintenance mode.Note that, depending on the implementation of the wakeup method, the client may never receive an indicator of success in the returned task. In some cases, it is not even possible to ensure that the wakeup request has made it to the host.The task is cancellable.
  since: `VI API 2.5`_


  Privilege:
               Host.Config.Maintenance



  Args:
    timeoutSec (`int`_):
       The task completes when the host successfully exits standby state and sends a heartbeat signal. If nothing is received from the host for timeoutSec seconds, the host is declared timedout, and the task is assumed failed.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.HostPowerOpFailed`_: 
       if the standby operation fails.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_:
