vim.event.NoMaintenanceModeDrsRecommendationForVM
=================================================
  This event records that DRS did not recommend a migration for a powered on virtual machine, even though its host is going into maintenance mode. DRS may not be able to recommend a migration for a virtual machine for reasons, include but not limited to:
   * No other connected host is compatible with this virtual machine.
   * None of the other compatible hosts have sufficient resources to satisfy the reservation requirements of this virtual machine.
   * Moving to any other host would violate a DRS rule. For example, all other compatible hosts have some incompatible virtual machines running.
   * DRS is disabled on this virtual machine.
   * This virtual machine was still in the process of migrating into the host going into maintenance mode and was not considered by DRS.
   * This virtual machine was in the process of migrating to another host when the host tried to enter maintenance mode.
   *
