    exportOption (`str`_, optional):

       An optional argument for modifying the export process. The option is used to control what extra information that will be included in the OVF descriptor.To get a list of supported keywords see `ovfExportOption`_ . Unknown options will be ignored by the server.
    snapshot (`vim.vm.Snapshot`_, optional):

       Snapshot reference from which the OVF descriptor should be based.If this parameter is set, the OVF descriptor is based off the snapshot point. This means that the OVF descriptor will have the same configuration as the virtual machine at the time the snapshot was taken.The snapshot must be belong to the specified ManagedEntity in the createDescriptor call.
