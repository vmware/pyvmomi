vim.VirtualMachine
==================
  VirtualMachine is the managed object type for manipulating virtual machines, including templates that can be deployed (repeatedly) as new virtual machines. This type provides methods for configuring and controlling a virtual machine.VirtualMachine extends the ManagedEntity type because virtual machines are part of a virtual infrastructure inventory. The parent of a virtual machine must be a folder, and a virtual machine has no children.Destroying a virtual machine disposes of all associated storage, including the virtual disks. To remove a virtual machine while retaining its virtual disk storage, a client must remove the virtual disks from the virtual machine before destroying it.


:extends: vim.ManagedEntity_


Attributes
----------
    capability (`vim.vm.Capability`_):
       Information about the runtime capabilities of this virtual machine.
    config (`vim.vm.ConfigInfo`_):
       Configuration of this virtual machine, including the name and UUID.This property is set when a virtual machine is created or when the `reconfigVM`_ method is called.The virtual machine configuration is not guaranteed to be available. For example, the configuration information would be unavailable if the server is unable to access the virtual machine files on disk, and is often also unavailable during the initial phases of virtual machine creation.
    layout (`vim.vm.FileLayout`_):
       Detailed information about the files that comprise this virtual machine.
    layoutEx (`vim.vm.FileLayoutEx`_):
       Detailed information about the files that comprise this virtual machine.Can be explicitly refreshed by the `RefreshStorageInfo`_ operation. In releases after vSphere API 5.0, vSphere Servers might not generate property collector update notifications for this property. To obtain the latest value of the property, you can use PropertyCollector methods RetrievePropertiesEx or WaitForUpdatesEx. If you use the PropertyCollector.WaitForUpdatesEx method, specify an empty string for the version parameter. Any other version value will not produce any property values as no updates are generated.
    storage (`vim.vm.StorageInfo`_):
       Storage space used by the virtual machine, split by datastore. Can be explicitly refreshed by the `RefreshStorageInfo`_ operation. In releases after vSphere API 5.0, vSphere Servers might not generate property collector update notifications for this property. To obtain the latest value of the property, you can use PropertyCollector methods RetrievePropertiesEx or WaitForUpdatesEx. If you use the PropertyCollector.WaitForUpdatesEx method, specify an empty string for the version parameter. Any other version value will not produce any property values as no updates are generated.
    environmentBrowser (`vim.EnvironmentBrowser`_):
       The current virtual machine's environment browser object. This contains information on all the configurations that can be used on the virtual machine. This is identical to the environment browser on the `ComputeResource`_ to which this virtual machine belongs.
    resourcePool (`vim.ResourcePool`_):
       The current resource pool that specifies resource allocation for this virtual machine.This property is set when a virtual machine is created or associated with a different resource pool.Returns null if the virtual machine is a template or the session has no access to the resource pool.
    parentVApp (`vim.ManagedEntity`_):
       Reference to the parent vApp.
    resourceConfig (`vim.ResourceConfigSpec`_):
       The resource configuration for a virtual machine. The shares in this specification are evaluated relative to the resource pool to which it is assigned. This will return null if the product the virtual machine is registered on does not support resource configuration.To retrieve the configuration, you typically use `childConfiguration`_ .To change the configuration, use `UpdateChildResourceConfiguration`_ .
    runtime (`vim.vm.RuntimeInfo`_):
       Execution state and history for this virtual machine.The contents of this property change when:
        * the virtual machine's power state changes.
        * an execution message is pending.
        * an event occurs.
    guest (`vim.vm.GuestInfo`_):
       Information about VMware Tools and about the virtual machine from the perspective of VMware Tools. Information about the guest operating system is available in VirtualCenter. Guest operating system information reflects the last known state of the virtual machine. For powered on machines, this is current information. For powered off machines, this is the last recorded state before the virtual machine was powered off.
    summary (`vim.vm.Summary`_):
       Basic information about this virtual machine. This includes:
        * runtimeInfo
        * guest
        * basic configuration
        * alarms
        * performance information
    datastore (`vim.Datastore`_):
      privilege: System.View
       A collection of references to the subset of datastore objects in the datacenter that is used by this virtual machine.
    network (`vim.Network`_):
      privilege: System.View
       A collection of references to the subset of network objects in the datacenter that is used by this virtual machine.
    snapshot (`vim.vm.SnapshotInfo`_):
       Current snapshot and tree. The property is valid if snapshots have been created for this virtual machine.The contents of this property change in response to the methods:
        * `CreateSnapshot_Task`_
        * `RevertToCurrentSnapshot_Task`_
        * `RemoveSnapshot_Task`_
        * `RevertToSnapshot_Task`_
        * `RemoveAllSnapshots_Task`_
    rootSnapshot (`vim.vm.Snapshot`_):
       The roots of all snapshot trees for the virtual machine.
    guestHeartbeatStatus (`vim.ManagedEntity.Status`_):
       The guest heartbeat. The heartbeat status is classified as:
        * gray - VMware Tools are not installed or not running.
        * red - No heartbeat. Guest operating system may have stopped responding.
        * yellow - Intermittent heartbeat. May be due to guest load.
        * green - Guest operating system is responding normally.The guest heartbeat is a statistics metric. Alarms can be configured on this metric to trigger emails or other actions.


Methods
-------


RefreshStorageInfo():
   Explicitly refreshes the storage information of this virtual machine, updating properties `storage`_ , `layoutEx`_ and `storage`_ .
  since: `vSphere API 4.0`_


  Privilege:
               System.Read



  Args:


  Returns:
    None
         


CreateSnapshot(name, description, memory, quiesce):
   Creates a new snapshot of this virtual machine. As a side effect, this updates the current snapshot.Snapshots are not supported for Fault Tolerance primary and secondary virtual machines.Any % (percent) character used in this name parameter must be escaped, unless it is used to start an escape sequence. Clients may also escape any other characters in this name parameter.


  Privilege:
               VirtualMachine.State.CreateSnapshot



  Args:
    name (`str`_):
       The name for this snapshot. The name need not be unique for this virtual machine.


    description (`str`_, optional):
       A description for this snapshot. If omitted, a default description may be provided.


    memory (`bool`_):
       If TRUE, a dump of the internal state of the virtual machine (basically a memory dump) is included in the snapshot. Memory snapshots consume time and resources, and thus take longer to create. When set to FALSE, the power state of the snapshot is set to powered off. `capabilities`_ indicates whether or not this virtual machine supports this operation.


    quiesce (`bool`_):
       If TRUE and the virtual machine is powered on when the snapshot is taken, VMware Tools is used to quiesce the file system in the virtual machine. This assures that a disk snapshot represents a consistent state of the guest file systems. If the virtual machine is powered off or VMware Tools are not available, the quiesce flag is ignored.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         the newly created Snapshot.

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.TaskInProgress`_: 
       if the virtual machine is busy.

    `vim.fault.SnapshotFault`_: 
       if an error occurs during the snapshot operation. Typically a more specific fault like MultipleSnapshotsNotSupported is thrown.

    `vim.fault.VmConfigFault`_: 
       if the virtual machine's configuration is invalid. Typically, a more specific fault like InvalidSnapshotState is thrown.

    `vim.fault.FileFault`_: 
       if there is a problem with creating or accessing one or more files needed for this operation.

    `vim.fault.InvalidName`_: 
       if the specified snapshot name is invalid.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed because of the virtual machine's current state. For example, the virtual machine configuration information is not available.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host product does not support snapshots or if the host does not support quiesced snapshots and the quiesce parameter is set to true; or if the virtual machine is a Fault Tolerance primary or secondary

    `vim.fault.InvalidPowerState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed in the current power state of the virtual machine.


RevertToCurrentSnapshot(host, suppressPowerOn):
   Reverts the virtual machine to the current snapshot. This is equivalent to doing snapshot.currentSnapshot.revert.If no snapshot exists, then the operation does nothing, and the virtual machine state remains unchanged.


  Privilege:
               VirtualMachine.State.RevertToSnapshot



  Args:
    host (`vim.HostSystem`_, optional):
       (optional) Choice of host for the virtual machine, in case this operation causes the virtual machine to power on.If a snapshot was taken while a virtual machine was powered on, and this operation is invoked after the virtual machine was powered off, the operation causes the virtual machine to power on to reach the snapshot state. This parameter can be used to specify a choice of host where the virtual machine should power on.If this parameter is not set, and the vBalance feature is configured for automatic load balancing, a host is automatically selected. Otherwise, the virtual machine keeps its existing host affiliation.This is not supported for virtual machines associated with hosts on ESX 2.x servers.


    suppressPowerOn (`bool`_, optional, since `vSphere API 4.0`_ ):
       (optional) If set to true, the virtual machine will not be powered on regardless of the power state when the current snapshot was created. Default to false.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.TaskInProgress`_: 
       if the virtual machine is busy.

    `vim.fault.SnapshotFault`_: 
       if an error occurs during the snapshot operation. Typically, a more specific fault like InvalidSnapshotFormat is thrown.

    `vim.fault.InsufficientResourcesFault`_: 
       if this operation would violate a resource usage policy.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed because of the virtual machine's current state. For example, if the virtual machine configuration information is not available or if an OVF consumer is blocking the operation.

    `vim.fault.VmConfigFault`_: 
       if a configuration issue prevents the power-on. Typically, a more specific fault, such as UnsupportedVmxLocation, is thrown.

    `vim.fault.NotFound`_: 
       if the virtual machine does not have a current snapshot.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host product does not support snapshots.

    `vim.fault.InvalidPowerState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed in the current power state of the virtual machine.

    `vim.fault.DisallowedOperationOnFailoverHost`_: 
       if the virtual machine is being reverted to a powered on state and the host specified is a failover host. See `ClusterFailoverHostAdmissionControlPolicy`_ .


RemoveAllSnapshots(consolidate):
   Remove all the snapshots associated with this virtual machine. If the virtual machine does not have any snapshots, then this operation simply returns successfully.


  Privilege:
               VirtualMachine.State.RemoveSnapshot



  Args:
    consolidate (`bool`_, optional, since `vSphere API 5.0`_ ):
       (optional) If set to true, the virtual disks of the deleted snapshot will be merged with other disk if possible. Default to true.




  Returns:
     `vim.Task`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.TaskInProgress`_: 
       if the virtual machine is busy.

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed because of the virtual machine's current state. For example, if the virtual machine configuration information is not available.

    `vim.fault.SnapshotFault`_: 
       if an error occurs during the snapshot operation. Typically, a more specific fault like InvalidSnapshotFormat is thrown.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the host product does not support snapshots.

    `vim.fault.InvalidPowerState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed in the current power state of the virtual machine.


ConsolidateVMDisks():
   Consolidate the virtual disk files of the virtual machine by finding hierarchies of redo logs that can be combined without violating data dependency. The redundant redo logs after merging are then deleted. Consolidation improves I/O performance since less number of virtual disk files need to be traversed; it also reduces the storage usage. However additional space is temporarily required to perform the operation. Use `EstimateStorageForConsolidateSnapshots_Task`_ to estimate the temporary space required. Consolidation can be I/O intensive, it is advisable to invoke this operation when guest is not under heavy I/O usage.

    `vim.fault.FileFault`_: 
       if if there is a problem creating or accessing the virtual machine's files for this operation. Typically a more specific fault for example `NoDiskSpace`_ is thrown.

    `vim.fault.VmConfigFault`_: 
       if a virtual machine configuration issue prevents consolidation. Typically, a more specific fault is thrown such as `InvalidDiskFormat`_ if a disk cannot be read, or `InvalidSnapshotFormat`_ if the snapshot configuration is invalid.


EstimateStorageForConsolidateSnapshots():
   Estimate the temporary space required to consolidation disk files. The estimation is a lower bound if the childmost writable disk file will be consolidated for an online virtual machine, it is accurate for all other situations. This is because the space requirement depending on the size of the childmost disk file and how write intensive the guest is.This method can be used prior to invoke consolidation via `ConsolidateVMDisks_Task`_ .

PowerOnVM(host):
   Powers on this virtual machine. If the virtual machine is suspended, this method resumes execution from the suspend point.When powering on a virtual machine in a cluster, the system might implicitly or due to the host argument, do an implicit relocation of the virtual machine to another host. Hence, errors related to this relocation can be thrown. If the cluster is a DRS cluster, DRS will be invoked if the virtual machine can be automatically placed by DRS (see `DrsBehavior`_ ). Because this method does not return a DRS `ClusterRecommendation`_ , no vmotion nor host power operations will be done as part of a DRS-facilitated power on. To have DRS consider such operations use `PowerOnMultiVM_Task`_ . As of vSphere API 5.1, use of this method with vCenter Server is deprecated; use `PowerOnMultiVM_Task`_ instead.If this virtual machine is a fault tolerant primary virtual machine, its secondary virtual machines will be started on system-selected hosts. If the virtual machines are in a VMware DRS enabled cluster, then DRS will be invoked to obtain placements for the secondaries but no vmotion nor host power operations will be considered for these power ons.

               VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOn



  Args:
    host (`vim.HostSystem`_, optional):
       (optional) The host where the virtual machine is to be powered on. If no host is specified, the current associated host is used.

PromoteDisks(unlink, disks):
   Promotes disks on this virtual machine that have delta disk backings.A delta disk backing is a way to preserve a virtual disk backing at some point in time. A delta disk backing is a file backing which in turn points to the original virtual disk backing (the parent). After a delta disk backing is added, all writes go to the delta disk backing. All reads first try the delta disk backing and then try the parent backing if needed.Promoting does two things
    * If the unlink parameter is true, any disk backing which is shared shared by multiple virtual machines is copied so that this virtual machine has its own unshared version. Copied files always end up in the virtual machine's home directory.
    * Any disk backing which is not shared between multiple virtual machines and is not associated with a snapshot is consolidated with its child backing.If the unlink parameter is true, the net effect of this operation is improved read performance, at the cost of disk space. If the unlink parameter is false the net effect is improved read performance at the cost of inhibiting future sharing.This operation is only supported if `deltaDiskBackingsSupported`_ is true.This operation is only supported on VirtualCenter.

QueryChangedDiskAreas(snapshot, deviceKey, startOffset, changeId):
   Get a list of areas of a virtual disk belonging to this VM that have been modified since a well-defined point in the past. The beginning of the change interval is identified by "changeId", while the end of the change interval is implied by the snapshot ID passed in.Note that the result of this function may contain "false positives" (i.e: flag areas of the disk as modified that are not). However, it is guaranteed that no changes will be missed.
  since: `vSphere API 4.0`_


  Privilege:

  Args:
    snapshot (`vim.vm.Snapshot`_, optional):
       Snapshot for which changes that have been made sine "changeId" should be computed. If not set, changes are computed against the "current" snapshot of the virtual machine. However, using the "current" snapshot will only work for virtual machines that are powered off.


    deviceKey (`int`_):
       Identifies the virtual disk for which to compute changes.


    startOffset (`long`_):
       Start Offset in bytes at which to start computing changes.

    changeId (`str`_):
       Identifyer referring to a point in the past that should be used as the point in time at which to begin including changes to the disk in the result. A typical use case would be a backup application obtaining a changeId from a virtual disk's backing info when performing a backup. When a subsequent incremental backup is to be performed, this change Id can be used to obtain a list of changed areas on disk.




  Returns:
    `vim.VirtualMachine.DiskChangeInfo`_:
         Returns a data structure specifying extents of the virtual disk that have changed since the thime the changeId string was obtained.

reloadVirtualMachineFromPath(configurationPath):
   Reloads the configuration for this virtual machine from a given datastore path. This is equivalent to unregistering and registering the virtual machine from a different path. The virtual machine's hardware configuration, snapshots, guestinfo variables etc. will be replaced based on the new configuration file. Other information associated with the virtual machine object, such as events and permissions, will be preserved.This method is only supported on vCenter Server. It can be invoked on inaccessible or orphaned virtual machines, but it cannot be invoked on powered on, connected virtual machines. Both the source virtual machine object and the destination path should be of the same type i.e. virtual machine or template. Reloading a virtual machine with a template or vice-versa is not supported.Note:Since the API replaces the source configuration with that of the destination, if the destination configuration does not refer to a valid virtual machine, it will create an invalid virtual machine object. This API should not be invoked on fault tolerant virtual machines since doing so will leave the original virtual machine's configuration in an invalid state. It is recommended that you turn off fault tolerance before invoking this API.

    `vim.fault.AlreadyExists`_: 
       if the virtual machine is already registered.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if invoked on ESX server or if invoked on a virtual machine with the destination path for a template and vice-versa.


QueryFaultToleranceCompatibility():
   This API can be invoked to determine whether a virtual machine is compatible for Fault Tolerance. The API only checks for VM-specific factors that impact compatibility for Fault Tolerance. Other requirements for Fault Tolerance such as host processor compatibility, logging nic configuration and licensing are not covered by this API. The query returns a list of faults, each fault corresponding to a specific incompatibility. If a given virtual machine is compatible for Fault Tolerance, then the fault list returned will be empty.

  Privilege:
               VirtualMachine.Config.QueryFTCompatibility



  Args:


  Returns:
    `vmodl.MethodFault`_:
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the operation cannot be performed because of the virtual machine's current state.

    `vim.fault.VmConfigFault`_: 
       if the virtual machine's configuration is invalid.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if the virtual machine is a template or this operation is not supported.


TerminateVM():
   Do an immediate power off of a VM.This API issues a SIGKILL to the vmx process of the VM. Pending synchronous I/Os may not be written out before the vmx process dies depending on accessibility of the datastore.

  Privilege:
               VirtualMachine.Interact.PowerOff



  Args:


  Returns:
    None
         

  Raises:

    `vim.fault.InvalidState`_: 
       if the VM is not powered on or another issue prevents the operation from being performed.

    `vim.fault.TaskInProgress`_: 
       if the virtual machine is busy.

    `vmodl.fault.NotSupported`_: 
       if this operation is not supported.
