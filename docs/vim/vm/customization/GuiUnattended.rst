vim.vm.customization.GuiUnattended
==================================
  The GuiUnattended type maps to the GuiUnattended key in thesysprep.infanswer file. These values are plugged directly into thesysprep.inffile that VirtualCenter stores on the target virtual disk. For more detailed information, see the document `Windows 2000 Unattended Setup Guide`_ .
:extends: vmodl.DynamicData_

Attributes:
    password (`vim.vm.customization.Password`_, optional):

       The new administrator password for the machine. To specify that the password should be set to blank (that is, no password), set the password value to NULL. Because of encryption, "" is NOT a valid value.If the XML file is generated by the VirtualCenter Customization Wizard, then the password is encrypted. Otherwise, the client should set the plainText attribute to true, so that the customization process does not attempt to decrypt the string.
    timeZone (`int`_):

       The time zone for the new virtual machine. Numbers correspond to time zones listed in sysprep documentation at `in Microsoft Technet.`_ 
    autoLogon (`bool`_):

       Flag to determine whether or not the machine automatically logs on as Administrator. See also the password property.
    autoLogonCount (`int`_):

       If the AutoLogon flag is set, then the AutoLogonCount property specifies the number of times the machine should automatically log on as Administrator. Generally it should be 1, but if your setup requires a number of reboots, you may want to increase it. This number may be determined by the list of commands executed by the `GuiRunOnce`_ command.
