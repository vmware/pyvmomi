vim.vm.check.TestType
=====================
  The types of tests which can requested by any of the methods in either `VirtualMachineCompatibilityChecker`_ or `VirtualMachineProvisioningChecker`_ .

  :type: `vim.vm.check.TestType`_

  :name: networkTests

values:
--------

hostTests
   Tests that examine both the virtual machine and the destination host or cluster; the destination resource pool is irrelevant. This set excludes tests that fall into the datastoreTests group.

resourcePoolTests
   Tests that check that the destination resource pool can support the virtual machine if it is powered on. The destination host or cluster is relevant because it will affect the amount of overhead memory required to run the virtual machine.

datastoreTests
   Tests that check that the destination host or cluster can see the datastores where the virtual machine's virtual disks are going to be located. The destination resource pool is irrelevant.

sourceTests
   Tests that examine only the configuration of the virtual machine and its current host; the destination resource pool and host or cluster are irrelevant.

networkTests
   Tests that check that the destination host or cluster can see the networks that the virtual machine's virtual nic devices are going to be connected.
