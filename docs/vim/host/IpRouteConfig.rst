vim.host.IpRouteConfig
======================
  IP Route Configuration. All IPv4 addresses, subnet addresses, and netmasks are specified as strings using dotted decimal notation. For example, "192.0.2.1".

The address can also consist of symbol '::' to represent multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous 0's only once in an address as described in RFC 2373.
