vim.host.VirtualNicConnection
=============================
  DataObject which provides a level of indirection when identifying VirtualNics during configuration. This dataObject lets users specify a VirtualNic in terms of the portgroup/Dv Port the Virtual NIC is connected to. This is useful in cases where VirtualNic will be created as part of a configuration operation and the created VirtualNic is referred to in some other part of configuration. e.g: for configuring VMotion
:extends: vmodl.DynamicData_
:since: `vSphere API 4.0`_

Attributes:
    portgroup (`str`_, optional):

       Name of the portgroup to which the virtual nic is connected to. If this parameter is set, use a virtual nic connected to a legacy portgroup.
    dvPort (`vim.dvs.PortConnection`_, optional):

       Identifier for the DistributedVirtualPort. If the virtual nic is to be connected to a DVS, #dvPort will be set instead of #portgroup
