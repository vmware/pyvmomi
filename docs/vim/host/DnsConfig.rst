vim.host.DnsConfig
==================
  This data object type describes the DNS configuration.All IPv4 addresses, subnet addresses, and netmasks are specified using dotted decimal notation. For example, "192.0.2.1". IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits. A colon separates each field (:). For example, 2001:DB8:101::230:6eff:fe04:d9ff. The address can also consist of the symbol '::' to represent multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous 0's only once in an address as described in RFC 2373.

Attributes:
    dhcp (`bool`_):

       The flag to indicate whether or not DHCP (dynamic host control protocol) is used to determine DNS configuration automatically.
    virtualNicDevice (`str`_, optional):

       If DHCP is enabled, the DHCP DNS of the service console network adapter will override the system DNS. This field is ignored if DHCP is disabled by the `dhcp`_ property.
    hostName (`str`_):

       The host name portion of DNS name. For example, "esx01".Note: When DHCP is not enabled, the property can be set explicitly. When DHCP is enabled, the property reflects the current DNS configuration, but cannot be set.
    domainName (`str`_):

       The domain name portion of the DNS name. For example, "vmware.com".Note: When DHCP is not enabled, the property can be set explicitly. When DHCP is enabled, the property reflects the current DNS configuration, but cannot be set.
    address (`str`_, optional):

       The IP addresses of the DNS servers, placed in order of preference.Note: When DHCP is not enabled, the property can be set explicitly. When DHCP is enabled, the property reflects the current DNS configuration, but cannot be set.
    searchDomain (`str`_, optional):

       The domain in which to search for hosts, placed in order of preference.Note: When DHCP is not enabled, the property can be set explicitly. When DHCP is enabled, the property reflects the current DNS configuration, but cannot be set.
