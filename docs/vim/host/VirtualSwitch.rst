vim.host.VirtualSwitch
======================
  The virtual switch is a software entity to which multiple virtual network adapters can connect to create a virtual network. It can also be bridged to a physical network.
:extends: vmodl.DynamicData_

Attributes:
    name (`str`_):

       The name of the virtual switch. Maximum length is 32 characters.
    key (`str`_):

       The virtual switch key.
    numPorts (`int`_):

       The number of ports that this virtual switch currently has.
    numPortsAvailable (`int`_):

       The number of ports that are available on this virtual switch. There are a number of networking services that utilize a port on the virtual switch and are not accounted for in the Port array of a PortGroup. For example, each physical NIC attached to a virtual switch consumes one port. This property should be used when attempting to implement admission control for new services attaching to virtual switches.
    mtu (`int`_, optional):

       The maximum transmission unit (MTU) associated with this virtual switch in bytes.
    portgroup (`vim.host.PortGroup`_, optional):

       The list of port groups configured for this virtual switch.
    pnic (`vim.host.PhysicalNic`_, optional):

       The set of physical network adapters associated with this bridge.
    spec (`vim.host.VirtualSwitch.Specification`_):

       The specification of a PortGroup.
