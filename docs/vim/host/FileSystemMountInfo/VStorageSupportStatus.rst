vim.host.FileSystemMountInfo.VStorageSupportStatus
==================================================
  Status of volume's support for vStorage hardware acceleration. The ESX Server determines the status based on the capabilities of the devices that support the file system volume. When a host boots, the support status is unknown. As the ESX host attempts hardware-accelerated operations, it determines whether the storage device supports hardware acceleration and sets the `vStorageSupport`_ property accordingly.
