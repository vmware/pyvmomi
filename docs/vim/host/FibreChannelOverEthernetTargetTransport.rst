vim.host.FibreChannelOverEthernetTargetTransport
================================================
  Fibre Channel Over Ethernet transport information about a SCSI target. FCoE transport information is that of: the regular FC World Wide Node and Port Names; the VNPort MAC address and FCF MAC address which constitute a VN_Port to VF_Port Virtual Link; and the VLAN on which an FCoE target resides. More FCoE information can be found in the working draft of the T11's Fibre Channel Backbone 5 standard (FC-BB-5). The draft can be found at http://www.t11.org.
