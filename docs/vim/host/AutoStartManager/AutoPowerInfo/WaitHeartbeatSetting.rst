vim.host.AutoStartManager.AutoPowerInfo.WaitHeartbeatSetting
============================================================
  Determines if the virtual machine should start after receiving a heartbeat, ignore heartbeats and start after the startDelay has elapsed, or follow the system default before powering on. When a virtual machine is next in the start order, the system either waits a specified period of time for a virtual machine to power on or it waits until it receives a successful heartbeat from a powered on virtual machine. By default, this is set to no.
