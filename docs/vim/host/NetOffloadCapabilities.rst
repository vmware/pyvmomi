vim.host.NetOffloadCapabilities
===============================
  Offload capabilities are used to optimize virtual machine network performance. When a virtual machine is transmitting on a network, some operations can be offloaded either to the host or to physical hardware. This data object type defines the set of offload capabilities that may be available on a host.This data object type is used both to publish the list of offload capabilities and to contain offload capability policy settings. The network policy logic is built on a two-level inheritance scheme which requires that all settings be optional. As a result, all properties on the NetOffloadCapabilities object must be optional.See `HostNetworkPolicy`_
