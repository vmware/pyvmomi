vim.host.TpmBootSecurityOptionEventDetails
==========================================
  Details of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) event recording kernel security option passed at boot time and currently in effect.This event type exists to simplify parsing of the security-related information by internal and third-party solutions. Each boot option may be passed to kernel multiple times and/or in different forms. Replicating the parsing logic of the kernel would be neither convinient, nor secure for the client applications.Each instance of this event reports details of a single security-related boot option, as set in the kernel.
