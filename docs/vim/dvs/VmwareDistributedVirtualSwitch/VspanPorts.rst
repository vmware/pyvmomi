vim.dvs.VmwareDistributedVirtualSwitch.VspanPorts
=================================================
  This class defines the ports, uplink ports name, vlans and IP addresses participating in a Distributed Port Mirroring session. See VspanSession.
:extends: vmodl.DynamicData_
:since: `vSphere API 5.0`_

Attributes:
    portKey (`str`_, optional):

       Individual ports to participate in the Distributed Port Mirroring session.
    uplinkPortName (`str`_, optional):

       Uplink ports used as destination ports to participate in the Distributed Port Mirroring session. A fault will be raised if uplinkPortName is used as source ports in any Distributed Port Mirroring session.
    wildcardPortConnecteeType (`str`_, optional):

       Wild card specification for source ports participating in the Distributed Port Mirroring session. See `DistributedVirtualSwitchPortConnecteeConnecteeType`_ for valid values. Any port that has a connectee of the specified type has its receive traffic mirrored. A fault will be raised if wildcards are specified as destination ports or source ports mirroring traffic on the transmit side. It is to be not used.
    vlans (`int`_, optional):

       Vlan Ids for ingress source of Remote Mirror destination session.
    ipAddress (`str`_, optional):

       IP address for the destination of encapsulated remote mirror source session, IPv4 address is specified using dotted decimal notation. For example, "192.0.2.1". IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits. A colon separates each field (:). For example, 2001:DB8:101::230:6eff:fe04:d9ff.
