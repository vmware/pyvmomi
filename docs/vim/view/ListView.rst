vim.view.ListView
=================
  The `ListView`_ managed object provides access to updates on a specific set of objects. You can use a `ListView`_ with a `PropertyCollector`_ method to retrieve data or receive notification of changes. For information about using views with the `PropertyCollector`_ , see the description of `ViewManager`_ .When you invoke the `CreateListView`_ method, you specify a list of objects. The `view`_ list always represents the current configuration of the virtual environment and reflects any subsequent changes that occur.
