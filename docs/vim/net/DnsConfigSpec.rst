vim.net.DnsConfigSpec
=====================
  Domain Name Server (DNS) Configuration Specification - a data object for configuring the RFC 1034 client side DNS settings. TBD: remove this section, only for discussing what goes into this object. Place properties here that are specific to the RFC/common to all systems. Properties that are platform specific should go into a separate config spec. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778792.aspx http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_DNS
:extends: vmodl.DynamicData_
:since: `vSphere API 4.1`_

Attributes:
    dhcp (`bool`_, optional):

       The flag to indicate whether or not dynamic host control protocol (DHCP) will be used to set DNS configuration automatically. See vim.net.DhcpConfigSpec
    hostName (`str`_, optional):

       The host name portion of DNS name. For example, "esx01" part of esx01.example.com. The rules for forming a hostname are specified in RFC 1034.
    domainName (`str`_, optional):

       The domain name portion of the DNS name. This would be the "example.com" part of esx01.example.com. The rules for forming a domain name are defined in RFC 1034.
    ipAddress (`str`_, optional):

       Unicast IP address(s) of one or more DNS servers in order of use. IPv4 addresses are specified using dotted decimal notation. For example, "192.0.2.1". IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses represented as eight fields of up to four hexadecimal digits. A colon separates each field (:). For example, 2001:DB8:101::230:6eff:fe04:d9ff. The address can also consist of the symbol '::' to represent multiple 16-bit groups of contiguous 0's only once in an address as described in RFC 2373.
    searchDomain (`str`_, optional):

       The domain in which to search for hosts in order of preference.
