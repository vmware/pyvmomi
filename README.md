* pyVmomi 5.5.0 and below support Python 2.6 and 2.7

Compatibility Policy
====================
pyVmomi versions are marked **vSphere version** _separator_ **release version**. Pyvmomi maintains minimum backward compatibility
with the previous _four_ releases of *vSphere* and it's own previous four releases. Compatibility with much older versions may
continue to work but will not be actively supported.

For example, version **v5.5.0**__2014.1_ is most compatible with vSphere 5.5, 5.1, 5.0, and 4.1 and was the first release in
2014. Initial releases compatible with a version of vSphere will bare a naked version number of **v5.5.0** indicating that
2015. version of pyVmomi was released simultaneously with the _GA_ version of vSphere with the same version number.
