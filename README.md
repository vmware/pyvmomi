pyVmomi is a Python SDK for the VMware vSphere API that allows you to
manipulate ESX, ESXi, and vCenter using scripts.

To get started, check out the samples project at http://vmware.github.io/pyvmomi-community-samples/

* community discussion on IRC freenode.net channels [#pyvmomi and #pyvmomi-dev](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#pyvmomi,#pyvmomi-dev)

You can install this as a package. Just run `python setup.py bdist_egg`
and then use `pip` or `easy_install` to deploy it on your system.

There are other bindings of this API in other languages. See:
